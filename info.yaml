# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "TI-based AES S-Box"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "Threshold Implementation based S-Box (Substitution Box) of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)"

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      This implementation of the S-Box follows Canright’s tower field approach and contains linear mappings to and from a $GF(2^4)$ normal base, 
      three instances of $GF(2^4)$ multipliers, one $GF(2^4)$ inverter and one square scaler. 
      
      In the first phase, three shares are processed by the linear input mapping and
      afterward fed into a multiplier and a uniform reduction to two shares $(a,b,c)\mapsto(a,b \oplus c)$ is fed into the square scaler. 
      The output of the multiplier is partially remasked by 8-bits of randomness while the square scaler output is left as is. 
      The result is saved in a register. In phase two the overall five shares are combined into four shares. Due to the previous remasking, this can be done uniformly as such:
      
      $$(x,y,a,b,c)\mapsto(x,y \oplus (r_1 \oplus r_2),a \oplus (b \oplus r_1),c \oplus r_2)$$

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, the counter should increase by one every second with a 10MHz input clock.
      Experiment by changing the inputs to change the counting speed.
